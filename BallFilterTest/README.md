If you delete images_backup I'll be sad.
The "notes.md" folder contains documentation on all test cases.

# TestImages Documentation

Tests we're looking for:
	Where the ball shows up ~6 times.
		In the middle
		Up top
		Near the bottom
	When people are walking over it
	When the ump is cleaning the plate
	When the batter is moving around/swinging
	When it's pretty much empty
