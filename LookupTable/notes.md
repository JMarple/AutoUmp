This is when there's no object in there.
Is data moving from one core to another?

Clock ticks (@100Mhz) = 687511
Clock ticks (@100Mhz) = 6078106

-------

These are the numbers that we see from one camera or the other when we comment out  "ff1 <: bitImage1;" or vice versa. Basically, we're only seeing the issue when we're performing floodfill on two different pictures.

------
Need to make the lookup table


------ 
Need to do the math of the intersection code, accounting for tilt

------ 
Need to deal with the distortion that we're seeing.
